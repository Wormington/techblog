## The first steps
When I first started writing JavaScript, I had already a good basis concept of programming from Java (I have been studying computer science for a year before changing study). I was busy learning HTML and CSS for the first semester of my study, when [Joachim Harris](https://www.joachimharris.com/techblog/) urged me to check the wonders of website creation with JavaScript and all the splendours in form of packages that followed. I immediately wanted to learn JavaScript  to manipulate the elements in HTML and CSS, but it went on hold for 4 months before I even started.

The motivation came, when I realised i wouldn't get a challenge in programming on the study, and i started taking JavaScript courses on [https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). These websites helped me a lot to understand the syntax and basic functions of JavaScript.

## Finding projects
An important aspect, that I completly neglected during my baby steps, is making projects, while you learn. I found comfort and ease by following the websites, and though to myself: I'm a coder in JavaScript! Oh boy, was i wrong! By blindly following the guidelines and were almost handed the solutions, I didn't learn the most important part of coding! I could not solve problems on my own. I could write basic functions, load in a HTML element and style it, but that was basically it.

I urge everyone to try solving problems themselves while taking these guides. Make a calculator, clock, or a third program just to test your skills, as you learn more and more. I've only first now started making my own websites and projects, and I can feel the concequences of my choice.

## Starting the journey
Even though I've fallen some times in my babysteps, I still really like all the possibillities you can use and create with JavaScript, and I'm ready to start an amazing journey with the members in Spakt and the fantastic coding community around me.
