Recently I started writing a
[book on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/types-for-the-eager-language-learner).
This was a first and, frankly, I had
no real idea about what to write about.

Presently I have spend quite some time studying type systems. That includes
both formal studies and the Haskell type system. I found that after i began
to enjoy increased knowledge about types, I became a much better programmer
in languages like JavaScript, Java, and C#.

Furthermore I saw that mu ventures into new languages was strictly more
successful. It was much easier to learn a new language when I had the
ability to boil everything down to the typing concepts.

My thinking and research began. I concluded that the types system is
a latent framework for reasoning which is similar across programming
languages. After learning types the link between Java interfaces and
Haskell type classes was a much more coherent unit.

My initial ventures into types was through a hard path. I spend hours with
Pierces books and papers. The lingo in most cases confused more than they
resolved, and it was very hard to link it to any existing knowledge.

Therefor I decided to write a book that explains type theory for the
programmer who has a strong foundation in languages such as JavaScript
and Java. Programmers who haven't ventured into Haskell or other
functional programming languages, but really want to consider these languages.

# The Book
The book is written using the lean methodology. This means that it will
be gradually published, and that I am very keen on getting feedback all the
time.

I will publish a chapter when it is initially finished for publishing. This
is when I am content with the writing, have done copy writing and the chapter
s coherent. 

A published chapter is not written in stone. This means that I am more than 
willing to rewrite a chapter when I get good arguments on alternative material.

As for the pricing I have initially decided that the book will cost 5$ pr.
chapter. This means that the book will increase in value when more chapters
are added. I find this quite fair and it also incentivises to buy the book
early on, which gives me more time to finish it.

# The Progress
Following is my progress on the book. Even this is not written in stone.
So if anybody wants a special chapter, please let me know, and I might
change the curriculum of the book.

| Chapters                    | Current Status       |
| --------------------------- |:--------------------:|
| Introduction                |  Writing             |
| Basic Types                 |  Writing             |
| Intermedio - Appling        |  Staging             |
| Polymorphic Types           |  Staging             |
| Existensial Types           |  Staging             |
| Reference Types             |  Staging             |
| Intermedio - Applying       |  Staging             |
| Sub Typing                  |  Staging             |

The book is available on 
[leanpub.com/types-for-the-eager-language-learner](https://leanpub.com/types-for-the-eager-language-learner). And I appreciate any encouragement.
That does not have to be of monetary art, but just a word that my work is
appreciated.
