My current academic endeavors are in the field of probabilistic programming. I
will wok this area until roughly June 2017. In the end it should hopefully
translate to a thesis.

This document is my public working document. It indexes my public writings
about my studies and work while it also provides a structure on what I am
doing.

If you wan to follow my work there are a couple of ways. I will tweet
on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/madspbuch) every time I release
new articles. So start following me :-) !
Otherwise this page will be updated with any new information. So saving
a link to this post is also an option.

Another option is to sign up for my mailing list for this project. I will
not spam you, but send a mail from time to time - at maximum bi-weekly.

# Blog Articles
To develop anything new, we need to know what new is. Here I index studies
on existing systems and concepts.

* [The Probability Monad](/blog/the-probability-monad/) - Coming very soon!

# Applications
Though applications is not strictly an academic necessity, it is kind
of nice. My investigations of practical applications go here.

# Thesis
The thesis project is not fully decided yet. When it is, this section is
devoted to linking resources and discussing the progress.

# Log
Following is the log on the project.
