## The first day
I have gotten a job as an IT-consultant at Spakt. I had an intro meeting with my co-worker [Joachim Harris](http://www.joachimharris.com/) and my first client the week before my first day, and I had already worked at an apps-caf√©, where you help people in need with IT. Therefore I felt quite comfortable with my situation, and how to handle the obstacles that would appear.

My guesses on what would happen the first day was not far-fetched. Mostly you consult and help people with their problems that might pop up during your time there. The focus was still on the main website, where I had to update some employee information in their [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) system and remove some posts, they had running. I also made sure the data of a new employee was set in correctly.

## Umbraco
When i started working with [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) the week before, i only had to look at the different components already made for the clients website so it was quite easy to navigate through and manipulate the information there. If the system is already set up, you just have to choose the component, you want to change or create, from the menu provided, and you're good to go.

## Evaluation
The whole experience so far has been very pleasant, and I can thank the people at Spakt for that, since they helped me make focus points and guided me through the first meeting with the customers. This also helped my nerves the first time, I had to work alone, and I felt, I was in good hands, if something went wrong. I'm looking forward to many new challenges and experiences that reveals themselves during my time at Spakt.
