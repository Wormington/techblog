My current academic endeavors are in the field of probabilistic programming. I
will wok this area until roughly June 2017. In the end it should hopefully
translate to a thesis.

This document is my public working document. It indexes my public writings
about my studies and work while it also provides a structure on what I am
doing.

# Blog Articles
To develop anything new, we need to know what new is. Here I index studies
on existing systems and concepts.

* [Genesis of Probabilistic Programming](#) - Coming very soon!

# Applications
Though applications is not strictly an academic necessity, it is kind
of nice. My investigations of practical applications go here.

# Thesis
The thesis project is not fully decided yet. When it is, this section is
devoted to linking resources and discussing the progress.
