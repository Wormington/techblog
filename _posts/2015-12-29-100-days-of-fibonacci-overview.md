title: 100 Days of Fibonacci - An Overview

A couple of weeks ago I started this project. The idea was to program
the Fibonacci function in as many languages as possible
and explore various concepts of
programming. I chose Fibonacci as my subject for this exploration as
it is a good function that is is simple to understand yet complicated
enough to show different programming techniques (unlike the _hello world_
example one usually goes for).

# Idea
The idea behind this project is manifold:

* Explore various styles of programming.
* Take small concepts and elaborate on these using a simple
  and well-elaborated base.
* Look at many languages.

But first of all, it is intended to just be a little side project
for killing a bit of time.

# Languages
This is the list on my current progress and a little elaboration on
the concept showcased.

1.  [Haskell](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-0-haskell/):
    This post introduces __direct recursion__ and __accumulated recursion__
    in Haskell.
2.  [C](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-1-c/):
    C as an imperative language is introduced, and Fibonacci was implemented
    in an __iterative style__.
3.  [Java](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-2-java/):
    The Fibonacci function is implemented by means of
    __dynamic programming__.
4.  [Scala](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-3-scala/):
    Scala is the language, __Continuation Passing style__ is the concept.
5.  [Prolog](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-4-prolog/):
    Fibonacci is here implemented in logic programming. Furthermore, we use
    ADTs to derive the argument to the function.
6.  [Spreadsheet](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-5-spreadsheet/):
    The key idea is to abstract the concept of programming to include more
    than written text.
7.  [JavaScript](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-6-javascript/):
    Introducing the concept of __events__ in JavaScript. This is a base for
    the concepts of streams, signals, etc. which will be introduced later on.
8.  [Coq](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-7-coq/):
    The introduction of __theorem proving__ using a programming language.
9.  [R](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-8-r/): Using R to plot the
    relationship between $$n$$ and $$fib(n)$$.
10. [Haskell Types](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-9-haskell-types/):
    Implementing the Fibonacci function using __dependent programming__
    in Haskell.
11. [Python](/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-10-python/):
    Focusing on the relationship between __list comprehensions__ and
    __set definitions__ in mathematics.

From here it is just following along. This project will stay current
quite some time while we explore the idiosyncrasies of programming
languages.
