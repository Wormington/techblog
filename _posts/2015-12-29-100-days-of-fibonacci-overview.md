title: 100 Days of Fibonacci - An Overview

A couple of weeks ago I started this project. The idea is to program
in as many languages as possible and explore various concepts of
programming. I chose Fibonacci as my subject for this exploration.
It is a good function because it is simple to understand yet complicated
enough to show different programming techniques (unlike he _hello world_
example one would usually go for).

# Idea
The idea behind this project is manyfold:

* Explore various styles of programming.
* Take small concepts and elaborate on these using a simple
  and well elaborated base.
* Look at many languages.

But first of all it is intended to just be a little side project
for killing a bit of time.

# Languages
Following are the different languages used so far and
a little note on what concept was showcased.

1. [Haskell](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-0-haskell/):
   This post introduces __direct recursion__ and accumulated
   recursion in Haskell.
2. [C](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-1-c/):
   C as an imperative language is introduced, and Fibonacci was implemented
   in an __iterative__ style.
3. [Java](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-2-java/):
   Dynamic Programming
4. [Scala](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-3-scala/):
   Continuation Passing style
5. [Prolog](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-4-prolog/):
   Logic programming, first introduction to problem modeling
   through ADT
6. [Spreadsheet](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-5-spreadsheet/)
   : Abstraction of the concept of programming.
7. [JavaScript](http://buchi.dk/blog/100-days-of-fibonacci-day-6-javascript/):
   Introducing the concept of events in JavaScript. This is a base for
   the concepts of streams, signals, etc. which are introduced later on.
