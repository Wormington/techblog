## Why Blogging via Git?
I use git to blog for multiple reasons:

* __Revision History:__ If anybody is interested using anything as a source the
  revision history for all articles is obtainable.
* __Offline Access:__ If anybody finds my article interesting they are very
  to download my full blog.
* __Git Features:__ When writing the articles I have all Git features accessible,
  that make maintenance a breeze.
